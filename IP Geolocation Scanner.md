The purpose of this tool is to fast track the IP Address data retrieved by going to sites like ipinfo.io or whois.com

This script pulls data from ipinfo.io using a token specifically allocated to a user account. So before using this, I advise navigating to ipinfo.io and creating a free account. Then grab your access token from there to input in the script on line 63.

This script will query data from public IP addresses and display it. Once you've finished with your queries you can also choose to output the data to a file. 

The script will notify you if the address is outside of the US and warn about safety. 

If a private IP is entered you will be notified and asked to provide a public IP address.
